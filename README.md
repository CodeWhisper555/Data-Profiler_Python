#  Advanced Statistical Engine (Backend)

This repository serves as the high-performance statistical backbone for the Data Profiler Suite. It takes over where the browser leaves off—handling complex multi-variable relationships and scientific visualizations.



##  What’s under the hood?
This engine uses the **SciPy stack** (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to generate automated insights:
- **Correlation Matrices:** Identifies hidden relationships between variables.
- **Heatmap Generation:** Uses the `mako` color palette for professional-grade reporting.
- **Distribution Metrics:** Provides a full `df.describe()` breakdown for numerical features.

##  Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Streamlit
- **Analysis:** Pandas
- **Visualization:** Seaborn & Matplotlib
- **Hosting:** Streamlit Cloud

##  Integration
This tool is meant to be launched from the [Main Web Dashboard] https://codewhisper555.github.io/Data-Profiler_Web/ when the user requires deeper data science capabilities.
